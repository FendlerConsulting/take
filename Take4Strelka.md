# Strelka and take4strelka #

Please read the README file in the archive take4strelka-0.1.zip. The R2MLAdapter is already included in this release.

You will need the strelka plugin version 0.2 to use this plugin. You can find it here: [Strelka](http://oxygen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/rewerse-i1/?q=Strelka).

Unfortunatly the UServ example shipped with strelka does not work with this plugin.
