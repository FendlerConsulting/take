  * [http://take.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/take/qa/jdepend/jdepend-report.html JDepend report] 

Note that these links point to the subversion repository. The content type returned is plain text, so you might not see the html in your browser. Well you might if you are using a browser that tries to be smarter than the http headers send by the server, such as MSIE.
