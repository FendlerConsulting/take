= Example =

The code for this example is in the [http://take.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/take/src/example/nz/org/take/compiler/example1/ repository]. The [http://take.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/take/src/example/nz/org/take/compiler/example1/crm-example.take script] contains only one rule: 

{{{
rule1: if equals(category(customer),goldCustomer) then discount(customer,goldCustomerDiscount) 
}}}

The utility `GenerateInterface` is used to generate a [http://take.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/take/src/example/nz/org/take/compiler/example1/spec/ public interface] for this script. In particular, the class `DiscountPolicy` with the method `getDiscount(Customer)` is generated. 

The `Example` script then does the following: 
  * reads the script from the rule
  * compiles the (rule) into Java sources
  * compiles the sources using the Java compiler API
  * binds the object references in the script
  * loads the generated class
  * queries the class for the discount for a given customer
  * prints the results and lists the rules used

Note that this mechanism works very much like JavaServerPages (JSPs)! The working directory containing the generated sources and compiled classes is in `/takeWorkingDir`.
