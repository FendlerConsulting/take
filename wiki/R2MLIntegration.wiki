# How to import other rule formats?

= Integration of the REWERSE Rule Markup Language (R2ML) =

[http://oxygen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/rewerse-i1/?q=R2ML R2ML] is a comprehensive and user-friendly XML rule format that allows
  * interchanging rules between different systems and tools,
  * enriching ontologies by rules,
  * connecting your rule system with (our) R2ML-based tools for vizualization, verbalization, verification and validation.

The goal of the R2ML subproject is to provide an import module that is able to map R2ML derivation rules into take and vice versa.

== So far its done... ==
Currently implemented are the following R2ML concepts:
||R2ML artifact||take artifact||remarks||
||RuleBase||KnowledgeBase||---||
||DerivationRuleSet||List of DerivationRules|| each rule is annotated with the RuleSetID||
||ProductionRuleSet||---||not supported||
||ReactionRuleSet||---||not supported||
||IntegrityRuleSet||---||not supported||
