#summary How to import other rule formats?

= Integration of the REWERSE Rule Markup Language (R2ML) =

[http://oxygen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/rewerse-i1/?q=R2ML R2ML] is a *comprehensive* and *user-friendly* XML rule format that allows
  * interchanging rules between different systems and tools,
  * enriching ontologies by rules,
  * connecting your rule system with (our) R2ML-based tools for visualization, verbalization, verification and validation.

The goal of the R2ML subproject is to provide an import module that is able to map R2ML derivation rules into take and vice versa. Hence the REWERSE Working Group I1 has developed several tools for transformation between different rule systems, it is straightforward to import many other rule formats into take.

== So far its done... ==
Currently implemented are the following R2ML concepts:
|| *R2ML element* || *take class* || remarks ||
|| RuleBase ||KnowledgeBase|| all rules from the contained RuleSets are added to the KnowledgeBase ||
|| DerivationRuleSet || List of DerivationRules || each contained derivation rule is annotated with the RuleSetID ||
|| ProductionRuleSet || --- || not supported ||
|| ReactionRuleSet || --- || not supported ||
|| IntegrityRuleSet || --- || not supported ||
|| DerivationRule || DerivationRule || ||
|| conclusion || DerivationRule::head || R2ML-Atoms are mapped into take-Facts ||
