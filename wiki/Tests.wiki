= Introduction =

[http://www.junit.org/index.htm JUnit] is used to test Take modules. 


= Details =

The test cases are in packages starting with the *test* token. Packages with a final token *generated* consist of classes generated by the take compiler. The script used to generate these classes is in the parent package, usually it is called *GenerateClasses*. 

== Package Description: ==

  # 'test.nz.org.take.script'  contains a test suite for the script parser
  # 'test.nz.org.take.compiler.scenario1' contains a test suite for code generated from a take knowledge base. Uses only simple rules and facts, and only simple data types (String)
  # 'test.nz.org.take.compiler.scenario2' contains a test suite for code generated from a take knowledge base. Uses only simple rules and facts, and only simple data types (String). This suite tests derivation tracing.
