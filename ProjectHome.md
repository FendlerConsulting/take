# TAKE (aka Mandarax Compiler) #

TAKE consists of a scripting language that can be used to define derivation rules, and a compiler that creates executable Java code and deploys it into running systems.

TAKE is inspired by [Mandarax](http://www.mandarax.org), has a similar API (and will have an adapter to import mandarax knowledge bases) but does not use a separate interpreter "inference engine". There is an [Eclipse plugin](http://code.google.com/p/take/wiki/TakeDT) that can be used to edit and compile TAKE rules.

The name TAKE is the Maori word for reason.

TAKE contains a comprehensive example based on the [UServ Product Derby Case Study](http://www.businessrulesforum.com/2005_Product_Derby.pdf).   Click [here](http://www-ist.massey.ac.nz/jbdietrich/userv/userv.jnlp) to launch the application using Java Webstart. Note that the size of the entire application (including user interface) is only **400kb**!
