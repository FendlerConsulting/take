# QA #

A couple of qa related reports are produced by the build script. These reports can be accessed here:



  * [JUnit report](http://take.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/take/qa/junit/index.html)
  * [JDepend report](http://take.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/take/qa/jdepend/jdepend-report.html)

Note that these links point to the subversion repository. The content type returned is plain text, so you might not see the html in your browser. Well you might if you are using a browser that tries to outsmart the http headers send by the server, such as MSIE.
